This is a solution to the [Crowdfunding product page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

## Overview

### The challenge

Recreate a site based off a jpg file, using html/css/javascript

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Toggle between themes
- perform basic calculations using the calculator.

Ideally I'd use SaSS or some pre-processor to navigate the themes, but my method works regardless.
