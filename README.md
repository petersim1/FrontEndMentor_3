This is a solution to the [Crowdfunding product page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR).

## Overview

### The challenge

Recreate a site based off a jpg file, using html/css/javascript

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the popup menus (there will not be any backend logic, but buttons should at least redirect users)

Really, the input dollar amount and submit button should be a form, so that I can require that a dollar amount is input.
